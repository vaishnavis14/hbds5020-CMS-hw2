It explores the accuracy of utilization day counts, trends in hospital stays, and patterns in depression-related hospitalizations. Special attention is given to beneficiaries with chronic depression in 2008, examining differences in claim payments and length of stay by race, and ending with a hypothesis based on observed disparities.
